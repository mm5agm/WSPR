If you download the sketches in order you will be able to see how each component works and end up with a single band WSPR beacon. You must be a licenced radio amateur to use the WSPR beacon. The order of sketches is
1) Get time from NTP server
2) Add real time clock
3) Scan I2C to find devices
4) Add OLED display
5) Add si5251 square wave generator and calibrate si5351
6) Add low pass filter and final program
The above programs will be added as and when I am happy with them.
